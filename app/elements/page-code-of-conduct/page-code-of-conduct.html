      <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

      <p>
        We value the participation of each member of the community and want
        everyone to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all
        members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make clear what is expected, all members, organizers and volunteers
        associated with the LibertyJS community are required to conform to the
        following Code of Conduct.
      </p>

    </paper-material>
    <paper-material elevation="1">

      <h3>
        The Short Version
      </h3>

      <p>
        The LibertyJS community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
        tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
      </p>

      <p>
        All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
        including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
        imagery is not appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave
        professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
        exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the LibertyJS community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the group at the sole
        discretion of the organizers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.
      </p>

      <h3>
        The Longer Version
      </h3>

      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
        other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive
        swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for the LibertyJS
        community.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct,
        the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
        warning the offender or expulsion from the group.
      </p>
