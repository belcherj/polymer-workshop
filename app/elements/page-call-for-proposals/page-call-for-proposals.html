      <h2>Call For Proposals</h2>
      <p>
        You should speak at LibertyJS! Yes you! We are looking for Speakers and
        Workshop Facilitators.
      </p>
      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We anonymize submissions, to avoid bias.
        </li>
        <li>A panel of four will score each proposal on 0 to 10 scale</li>
        <li>Scores are tallied</li>
        <li>
          A second round of votes will be tallied based on de-anonymized
          proposals.  This round will account for ability to cover travel, under
          represented individuals and new speakers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Panelists will be chosen from varied level of experience and gender</p>

      <h3>What we are looking for</h3>

      <p>
        We are looking for several Workshop leaders for the morning sessions.
        Topics should appeal to wide audience of JavaScript developers.  Last year
        our workshops included: AngularJS, Node, and an Intro to JS.
        Proposed workshops include: AngularJS, EmberJS, React, Polymer, JavaScript
        design patterns, functional JavaScript, etc. This list is not exhaustive
        and all proposals are welcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are looking for five speakers for the afternoon session.  All topics
        are welcome but should involve JavaScript. Please take into account that
        LibertyJS attendees will be of varied skill levels.
      </p>

      <h3>Call for Proposals ends Friday 5/29/2015</h3>
